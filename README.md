# CVM-AI-Classifier

An AI-driven system for automated cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) stage classification.

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based system for automatically classifying cervical vertebral maturation stages from lateral cephalometric radiographs. The system provides accurate CVM stage predictions with visualization capabilities through Grad-CAM heatmaps and confidence scores for clinical interpretation.

## Dataset

This project uses the **CVM-900** dataset. For more details on the dataset, including its citation, please refer to the [DATASET.md](./DATASET.md) file.

## Features

- Automated CVM stage classification (CS1-CS6)
- Interactive web interface for image analysis
- Grad-CAM heatmap visualization
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Combined view with heatmap overlay

## Demo

The application provides a comprehensive analysis interface for cervical vertebral maturation classification:

*Figure 1: Main interface showing image upload and analysis components*

The system provides three key visualizations:
1. Original radiographic image
2. Grad-CAM heatmap showing regions of interest
3. Combined view with heatmap overlay

Additionally, the system provides detailed confidence scores for each CVM stage:
